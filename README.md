# redux-eCommerce-platform

  ## Description 
  The Context API is quickly gaining traction as a worthy alternative or perhaps even successor to other libraries that manage global state in tandem with React, such as Flux or MobX. Nonetheless, the open-source JavaScript library Redux remains the industry standard for managing complex state in a large-scale React application. 
  This platform uses Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API, so that the website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem
